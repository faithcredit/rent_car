This is a class to encrypt and decrypt data using some algorithms and methods.
Actually it supports:
            - Blowfish 
            - ECB, CBC (modes)

0. Install

Verify if the algorithm files is in the cipher.

1. How To:

To use this class you need to instanciate it, selecting the mode, algorithm and key, then you can call encrypt and decrypt methods.

Example:
  
  require 'class.pcrypt.php';
  
  /* MODE: MODE_ECB or MODE_CBC
     ALGO: BLOWFISH
     KEY:  Your secret key :) (max lenght: 56)
  */
  $crypt = new pcrypt(MODE_ECB, "BLOWFISH", "secretkey");
  
  // to encrypt
  $plaintext  = "password";
  $ciphertext = $crypt->encrypt($plaintext);

  // to decrypt
  $decrypted  = $crypt->decrypt($ciphertext);

2. TODO

   - Implement other algorithms and block modes
   - Improve error handling function(s)
   - Implement methods to discover automatically the ALGO used (maybe a header)
   - Implement a method to change the key
   - Compatible with mcrypt
   - Correct bugs :)

That's all, if you get any trouble please contact.
